# SQL-Real-Estate-Data-Cleaning
In this project, I will do some minor data cleaning of the files I scraped from John Taylor French Riviera Real Estate Data.

Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suluetlinkowski/french-riviera-real-estate-data

Steps I did:
* Load data into BigQuery
* Cleaned data: Joined tables, formatted tables*
* Visualised data on Tableau
